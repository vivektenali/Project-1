# Street Style Landing Page

This is my first HTML+CSS project. 
where a HTML,imgs was given already, I need to desgin the landing page as per the mock desgin.
As it was my first hands-on web development project it took close to 8-10hrs to understand how the flow of selection and positioning icons and how to align them and much more.  

A lot of research has went in to get the idea on positioning and how absolute and relative works.



This Street Style Landing Page project is all about positioning of elements.
